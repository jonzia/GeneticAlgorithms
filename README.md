# Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithm applied to sorting shuffled datasets (MATLAB).

## Summary

This package implements genetic algorithms to sort data that may have been scrambled among different vectors. An example implementation of genetic algorithms is shown in `tutorials/genetic.m`. For additional help for each of the following functions, type `help smart.genetic.<function>` in the command window. Most functions are called by `smart.genetic.geneticSort()`.
